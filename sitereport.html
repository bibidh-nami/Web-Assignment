            <b>1. Web Development Learning Experience</b><br>
            During the development of this website, I gained hands-on experience with HTML and CSS, learning how to structure web pages semantically and style them effectively. I explored various layout techniques, including Flexbox, to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes. Additionally, I learned the importance of accessibility and best practices in web development to ensure a positive user experience for all visitors. Initially, I was excited to work with the site. However, it soon became a struggle when it began giving a lot of errors and when it didn't work according to my idea. But then again, it changed when it clicked, and the fun began when I started understanding exactly what part I need to change or edit, or even when I had to redo the entire code just out of seer confusion. Overall, it was an interesting assignment, and this will be a really valuable experience.

            <br><br><b>2. Design Decisions</b><br>
            The design of the website focuses on simplicity and clarity, using a clean layout with enough white space to enhance readability. I chose a consistent color scheme and typography to create a nice visual identity. The navigation is straightforward, allowing users to easily access different sections of the site. I also incorporated responsive design principles to ensure the site looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

            <br><br><b>3. Debugging</b><br>
            During the development process, I encountered several issues related to layout and responsiveness, especially with making sure the designs stay consistent with different screen sizes. I resolved these by carefully reviewing the CSS rules and adjusting the Flexbox properties to ensure elements aligned correctly across different screen sizes. Additionally, I fixed minor issues with image scaling and text alignment. Moreover, whenever confusion was faced regarding certain concepts, I referred to online documentations and also AI (Gemini and ChatGPT) in some cases to clarify my doubts. Also, I had faced an issue with embedding the youtube video in iframe because of which the video was not showing up properly. After researching online, I found that adding specific attributes to the iframe tag helped resolve the issue.

            <br><br><b>4. Validation Reports</b><br>
            The site has been validated using the W3C Markup Validation Service for HTML and the W3C CSS Validation Service for CSS. The HTML validation report shows that the code is free of errors and adheres to web standards, ensuring proper structure and semantics. The CSS validation report also indicates that the styles used are compliant with CSS standards, with no errors detected. Screenshot of the entire site's validation results is provided below for reference.
